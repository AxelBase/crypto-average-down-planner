This precision eliminates guesswork and ensures your strategy is executed correctly.</p> <p class="svelte-1apmzc4">The formula balances your existing position with the new purchase so that the weighted average of all costs equals your target average price. It accounts for the total cost and total units held after the additional buy.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1apmzc4">The Core Formula Explained</h2> <p class="svelte-1apmzc4">The amount to buy is calculated as: Amount to Buy = (Current Amount × (Current Average - Target Average)) / (Target Average - Market Price).</p> <p class="svelte-1apmzc4">This works because the numerator represents the total dollar reduction needed in your average, while the denominator shows how much reduction each new unit provides at the current lower market price. The result is the exact quantity required.</p> <h3 class="svelte-1apmzc4">Step-by-Step Breakdown</h3> <ul class="svelte-1apmzc4"><li class="svelte-1apmzc4">Calculate current total cost: Current Amount multiplied by Current Average</li> <li class="svelte-1apmzc4">Determine desired total cost after buying: (Current Amount + Amount to Buy) multiplied by Target Average</li> <li class="svelte-1apmzc4">Solve for Amount to Buy using the difference filled by the cheaper market price</li> <li class="svelte-1apmzc4">Verify new average matches target exactly</li></ul> <h3 class="svelte-1apmzc4">Example in Action</h3> <p class="svelte-1apmzc4">Suppose you hold 1 BTC bought at $60,000 average. The price drops to $40,000, and you want a $50,000 average. Plugging in: Amount to Buy = (1 × (60000 - 50000)) / (50000 - 40000) = 10000 / 10000 = 1 BTC. New total: 2 BTC at $100,000 total cost, average $50,000.</p> <p class="svelte-1apmzc4">With fractional coins like Ethereum, the same formula applies seamlessly for precise amounts.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1apmzc4">Why Precision Matters</h2> <p class="svelte-1apmzc4">Small errors in manual calculations can lead to buying too little or too much, missing your target average. The planner handles floating-point precision, rounding crypto amounts to eight decimals and fiat to two, ensuring readable and accurate results.</p> <p class="svelte-1apmzc4">It also derives new total amount, total cost, and confirms the new average hits your target exactly, providing full transparency.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1apmzc4">FAQ</h2> <details class="svelte-1apmzc4"><summary class="svelte-1apmzc4">Why can't I average down if market price is above target?</summary> <p class="svelte-1apmzc4">Buying at a higher price would increase, not decrease, your average. The tool blocks this to prevent illogical inputs.</p></details> <details class="svelte-1apmzc4"><summary class="svelte-1apmzc4">Does the formula work for any currency pair?</summary> <p class="svelte-1apmzc4">Yes, as long as prices are in the same fiat currency, typically USD.</p></details> <details class="svelte-1apmzc4"><summary class="svelte-1apmzc4">What if target average equals current average?</summary> <p class="svelte-1apmzc4">No additional purchase is needed, but the tool requires a lower target for meaningful averaging down.</p></details> <p class="italic-note svelte-1apmzc4">Understanding this formula empowers better decision-making in volatile markets.</p></article></div>`);function $(m){var e=A();w("1apmzc4",d=>{var s=b(),h=v(g(s),6);a(4),l(()=>c(h,"content",`${n??""}/blog/posts/post2`)),y(()=>{f.title="How the Average Down Calculation Works | Crypto Average Down Planner"}),r(d,s)});var t=o(e),u=o(t);a(4),i(t),a(2),i(e),l(()=>c(u,"href",`${n??""}/blog`)),r(m,e)}export{$ as component,D as universal};
